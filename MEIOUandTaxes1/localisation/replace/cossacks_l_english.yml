 tribal_estate_events.1.t:0 "Tensions between Nomads and Sedentary Population"
 tribal_estate_events.1.d:0 "The difference between tax collection, extortion or demanding tribute can sometimes be somewhat vague. In many parts of our country taxes are collected by the Nomadic Clans in ways very similar to how they would have conducted themselves during a raid.\nToday an emissary from some of our more well-to-do subjects arrived to tell a tale of how the would-be tax collectors pillaged their lands and then laid siege to their fortified homes. They now demand retribution from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and for the perpetrators to be punished. The tribes would, however, likely not take kindly to any such restrictions of their conduct."
 tribal_estate_events.1.a:0 "Reprimand the Chiefs."
 tribal_estate_events.1.b:0 "Support the Chiefs."
 tribal_estate_events.2.t:0 "Growth of Tribal Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.2.d:0 "A tribal state is always somewhat unstable. Some clans will quickly increase their influence over the others, only to collapse again just as suddenly. Lately a new group of tribal leaders have come to extend their power over the lesser tribes considerably."
 tribal_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.3.t:0 "Decline of Tribal Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.3.d:0 "Due to infighting between clans, poorly thought out political manoeuvres and conflicts relating to succession our influence over the other tribes has increased considerably during the last few years. This decline in tribal influence is unlikely to last but comes as a nice respite for now."
 tribal_estate_events.3.a:0 "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.4.t:0 "Local Chiefs Complain"
 tribal_estate_events.4.d:0 "Several Clan Chiefs have complained to us about young men from their area leaving their clans and joining our own army. They claim that this is not how it was done in the days of our father, and that every man should serve in his local clan's army first. What shall we do?"
 tribal_estate_events.4.a:0 "Send the young men home."
 tribal_estate_events.4.b:0 "Keep them in the army."
 tribal_estate_events.5.t:0 "Chiefs are withholding Taxes"
 tribal_estate_events.5.d:0 "One of our closest advisors has come to us with proof of the local Chiefs not paying much tax to us as one should expect from their lands. This is a delicate situation, but we need to come to a decision quickly."
 tribal_estate_events.5.a:0 "Their land, their rules!"
 tribal_estate_events.5.b:0 "Our land, our rules!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.t:0 "Our Tribes are in disarray!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.d:0 "Keeping nomadic tribes together is never an easy task and right now we are living through some dire times. The Tribes could very likely help us stabilise the situation so that we can get back on our feet but we would be increasing their influence over our state."
 tribal_estate_events.6.a:0 "Rely on the Tribes!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.b:0 "We do not need their help."
 tribal_estate_events.7.t:0 "Our Tribes view our leadership as weak!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.d:0 "Our military leadership is inexperienced and weak. The Tribes are questioning if they can really follow such green men into battle, offering instead to supply us with seasoned warriors ready to lead our troops."
 tribal_estate_events.7.a:0 "Rely on the Tribes!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.b:0 "We do not need their help."
 tribal_estate_events.8.t:0 "The Tribes are not unified!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] unified and the Tribes worry that we are becoming the object of ridicule. Prominent clan leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] offering to strengthen our rule though some would say that relying on others to enforce this unity makes for an unstable peace."
 tribal_estate_events.8.a:0 "Rely on the Tribes!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.b:0 "We do not need their help."
 tribal_estate_events.9.t:0 "Return to the Old Ways!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.d:0 "One of the Clan Chiefs has come forward, as a spokesman for their group, and urges us to return to the old ways, the ways that made us strong. 'Crush your enemies, drive them before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!'"
 tribal_estate_events.9.a:0 "That is what is good in life."
 tribal_estate_events.9.b:0 "That is in the past."
 tribal_estate_events.10.t:0 "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] Tribes"
 tribal_estate_events.10.d:0 "Not content to sit idly by while we take control over their lands the Tribes of [Root.GetName] have taken up arms against us."
 tribal_estate_events.10.a:0 "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.11.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tribal_estate_events.11.d:0 "A distant cousin of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to gain the gratitude of the tribes. Many strong tribal leaders are now demanding that we change the future plans of succession to ensure that this cousin is guaranteed his rightful place as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether they are motivated by true loyalty to our kinsman or feel he could easily be controlled is hard to tell but they would certainly not take refusal to follow their advice very well."
 tribal_estate_events.11.a:0 "A new heir it is!"
 tribal_estate_events.11.b:0 "These tribes must know their place!"
 tribal_estate_events.12.t:0 "Tribes demand more men"
 tribal_estate_events.12.d:0 "Prominent Tribal leaders have approached us demanding that we let them make use of the state resources to defend their lands. They claim that neighbouring states are making incursions and raids into the land they control and that the only efficient way to defend them is to put some of our troops directly under their command."
 tribal_estate_events.12.a:0 "Of course they shall have our men!"
 tribal_estate_events.12.b:0 "This is an excuse to weaken us!"
 tribal_estate_events.13.t:0 "Independent Tribes"
 tribal_estate_events.13.d:0 "Several leaders of the powerful Tribes in our country have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to complain about the unfair interference of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] representatives. The Tribes feel they should be left alone in accordance with their ancient rights."
 tribal_estate_events.13.a:0 "We must leave them alone then."
 tribal_estate_events.13.a.tt:0 "Every Province owned by the §YTribes§! will gain §R30§! Autonomy."
 tribal_estate_events.13.b:0 "We can tolerate no states within our state!"
 tribal_estate_events.14.t:0 "Demands of the Tribes"
 tribal_estate_events.14.d:0 "The Tribes feel that the talents of their generals are wasted on our armies and have demanded that their leaders be sent home to marshal their own troops. As we rely on them for most military matters this will result in quite a strain on our remaining leadership."
 tribal_estate_events.14.a:0 "Agree."
 tribal_estate_events.14.b:0 "They will do no such thing!"
 tribal_estate_events.15.t:0 "Wavering Loyalty of the Tribes"
 tribal_estate_events.15.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the Tribes grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current breed of chiefs in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 tribal_estate_events.15.a:0 "Ok."
 
 nobles_estate_events.1.t:0 "Noble Birth"
 nobles_estate_events.1.d:0 "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NO$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
 nobles_estate_events.1.a:0 "Guarantee their right to command our armies."
 nobles_estate_events.1.b:0 "We cannot commit to such promises."
 nobles_estate_events.2.t:0 "Advancement of the $ESTATE_NO$"
 nobles_estate_events.2.d:0 "The state is not the sole source of influence in our country. Over the last few decades a charismatic champion of the $ESTATE_NO$ has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the $ESTATE_NO$ over most of the institutions of our country.\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially combined with ambition."
 nobles_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.3.t:1 "Encroachment of the $ESTATE_NO$ in [noble_encroachment.GetName]"
 nobles_estate_events.3.d:1 "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_NO$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."
 nobles_estate_events.3.a:0 "Let it slide."
 nobles_estate_events.3.b:0 "Demand that the land be returned."
 nobles_estate_events.4.d:0 "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the $ESTATE_NO$ has approached the throne today imploring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_NO$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."
 nobles_estate_events.4.a:0 "Turn a blind eye."
 nobles_estate_events.4.b:0 "Chastise the landowner."
 nobles_estate_events.5.t:0 "Declining Power of the $ESTATE_NO$"
 nobles_estate_events.5.d:0 "As both influential land owners and the traditional warrior class in our state the $ESTATE_NO$ have not fared well lately. Through a combination of excessive infighting and poorly coordinated power plays the $ESTATE_NO$ have lost influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and many have retired to their properties in the countryside."
 nobles_estate_events.5.a:0 "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.6.t:0 "$ESTATE_NO$ demand Stricter Sumptuary Laws"
 nobles_estate_events.6.d:0 "Expensive clothes, great banquettes and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the $ESTATE_NO$ but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases the $ESTATE_BG$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NO$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."
 nobles_estate_events.6.d.1:0 "Expensive clothes, great banquettes and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the $ESTATE_NO$ but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases the Vaishyas of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NO$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."
 nobles_estate_events.6.a:0 "Bend to the wishes of the $ESTATE_NO$."
 nobles_estate_events.6.b:0 "Refuse to obey the $ESTATE_NO$."
 nobles_estate_events.7.t:0 "The Levee"
 nobles_estate_events.7.d:0 "In time many of the everyday occurrences in the life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors has become the subject of ceremony. Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_NO$ would likely resent it."
 nobles_estate_events.7.a:0 "Let's keep it at a modest level."
 nobles_estate_events.7.b:0 "An elaborate and lengthy ceremony for the most influential."
 nobles_estate_events.7.c:0 "We have no need of such things."
 nobles_estate_events.8.t:0 "Deteriorating Relations with the $ESTATE_NO$"
 nobles_estate_events.8.d:0 "Relations between the $ESTATE_NO$ and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the $ESTATE_NO$ but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."
 nobles_estate_events.8.a:0 "Leave them be."
 nobles_estate_events.8.b:0 "Force them to accept state authority."
 nobles_estate_events.9.t:0 "Insubordinate $ESTATE_NO$"
 nobles_estate_events.9.d:0 "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the $ESTATE_NO$. Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NO$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."
 nobles_estate_events.9.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 nobles_estate_events.9.b:0 "It is high time we replaced them with men of true ability."
 nobles_estate_events.9.c:0 "It is high time we replaced them with men we can trust."
 nobles_estate_events.10.t:0 "Growth of the Administration"
 nobles_estate_events.10.d:1 "As the state and its bureaucracy grow there is an ever-growing need of people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The $ESTATE_NO$ have traditionally been more associated with military services to the state but have increasingly made it clear that they still expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out. The $ESTATE_BG$ on the other hand claim that the $ESTATE_NO$ considers such appointments as mere rewards and will use them only to enrich themselves. Instead the $ESTATE_BG$ argue we should appoint men out of individual merit.\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the center of this conflict, with the $ESTATE_BG$ supporting one candidate and the $ESTATE_NO$ expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men this has to be a political decision."
 nobles_estate_events.10.a:0 "With a great pedigree come great abilities."
 nobles_estate_events.10.b:0 "Self-made men are what we need to run this country."
 nobles_estate_events.10.c:0 "Let us turn to the $ESTATE_CL$ instead."
 nobles_estate_events.11.t:0 "Tradition of Service"
 nobles_estate_events.11.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NO$ have a long tradition of service to the state both as military leaders or more recently as dependable administrators. In a state where the $ESTATE_NO$ are as strongly entrenched and loyal as ours this means that from time to time nobles of great talent and loyalty will emerge to lead the country to greatness."
 nobles_estate_events.11.a:0 "Great!"
 nobles_estate_events.12.t:0 "Rise of the [Root.GetName] $ESTATE_NO$"
 nobles_estate_events.12.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NO$ are refusing to accept the confiscation of their property in [Root.GetName] and have risen in revolt against us!"
