 Italian_bank_loans_Default:1 "Italian Bank Loan Defaulted"
 desc_Italian_bank_loans_Default:1 "Edward III’s excuse for his attack on France in 1337 was that Philip VI had appropriated the English king’s duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu and was now threatening further attacks from across the channel. The French maintained their “auld alliance” with the Scots, who despite an agreement between his father and Robert the Bruce after the battle of Bannockburn. were still not helping matters by continuing to raid England across the borderlands and create mayhem in protest against any notion of deference to any English King.\nTo finance this endeavour Edward III chose to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and to borrow money from the famous Banking families of Florence. In particular the Ricciardi of Lucca (1272-1294), the Frescobaldi of Florence (c.1294-1312) the Bardi family and above all in relation to this story, the Peruzzi family who were, until 1345, the rich patrons of Giotto di Bondone.  The Peruzzi and the Bardi families were the two that were most impacted by the English loan.\nThe Peruzzi family family lent Edward III 600,000 gold florins, whilst the Bardi family gambled even more bravely and lent him 900,000 florins.Failing in his quest to become hailed as the King of France Edward reneged on these payments and this led to the declaration of Bancarotta and the collapse of both Bardi & Peruzzi families’ banks in 1345 – with the consequence of a lot of negative vibes between the Florentines and future English requests for loans!"
