 HRE_war_mechanics.001.d:1 "The Empire is under attack by outside aggressors. Shall we ask the princes for help? \n\nRemember the following: \nIf the HRE alliance is stronger than the attacker alliance, the princes will most likely not contribute anything. If the alliances are on same strength, many princes will contribute to the war. If the enemy alliance is (significantly) stronger than the HRE alliance, almost all princes will continue."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_empire_for_help:1 "Demand Heerfolge from all princes!"
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_empire_for_help.ctp:1 "This will call for a Hoftag, in which the imperial estates will discuss if they want do give you help. It's likely they will help you. Also this will decrease the authority of the emperor. If they accept, all princes will be asked to support you in the war. They can give you manpower and money or only money. If they help you depends on your opinion to them, the Imperial Centralization and the reform desire of the empire. If the reform desire is high, they princes might request reforms before they give you help."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_great_princes_for_help:1 "Demand Heerfolge from the electors and the strong princes!"
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Ask_great_princes_for_help.ctp:1 "This will just ask for the help of the strong princes and the electors. It's relatively unlike they will help you. Only if you have good relations, they will do it. Perhaps they will request some privileges for it. They can give you manpower and money or only money. It will strengthen the authority of the electors in the empire and therefore weaken that of the emperor."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Do_it_alone:1 "No, the forces from our own domain shall suffice."
 HRE_war_mechanics.001.Do_it_alone.ctp: "You won't get help from the princes, but strengthen your authority in the empire, because you show that the emperor is strong enough to fend off the invader. If you later try to call for help anyways, you will suffer greater penalties."
