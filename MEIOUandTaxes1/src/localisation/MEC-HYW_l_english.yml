 desc_Italian_bank_loans_Default:1 "Edward III’s excuse for his attack on France in 1337 was that Philip VI had appropriated the English king’s duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu and was now threatening further attacks from across the channel. The French maintained their “auld alliance” with the Scots, who despite an agreement between his father and Robert the Bruce after the battle of Bannockburn. were still not helping matters by continuing to raid England across the borderlands and create mayhem in protest against any notion of deference to any English King.\nTo finance this endeavour Edward III chose to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and to borrow money from the famous Banking families of Florence. In particular the Ricciardi of Lucca (1272-1294), the Frescobaldi of Florence (c.1294-1312) the Bardi family and above all in relation to this story, the Peruzzi family who were, until 1345, the rich patrons of Giotto di Bondone.  The Peruzzi and the Bardi families were the two that were most impacted by the English loan.\nThe Peruzzi family family lent Edward III 600,000 gold florins, whilst the Bardi family gambled even more bravely and lent him 900,000 florins.Failing in his quest to become hailed as the King of France Edward reneged on these payments and this led to the declaration of Bancarotta and the collapse of both Bardi & Peruzzi families’ banks in 1345 – with the consequence of a lot of negative vibes between the Florentines and future English requests for loans!"

On the 10th October 1423 he married in Dijon Margaret of Burgundy, daughter of Duke Jean the Fearless, and was founded on 7. March 1425 appointed Connétable by King Charles VII. At the royal court in Bourges, Arthur was proteated by Yolande d'Aragon and became rivalry with Georges de La Trémoille. After Arthur's brother, Duke Jean, entered into an alliance with England in 1427, Arthur briefly fell into disgrace with the king.\nWith Jeanne d'Arc and Dunois at his side, Arthur commanded the French army in 1429 and defeated the English at Beaugency and Patay. After Trémoille was overthrown by intrigue in 1433, Arthur once again occupied a leading position at the court. In 1435, the Treaty of Arras was concluded through his mediation, in which King Charles VII recveded with the Duke of Burgundy. On the 13th In April 1436, Arthur solemnly found its way into liberated Paris and in the following years chased the English from Normandy and part of the Guyenne. He fended up with the attempt to recapture the Englishman in Normandy on 15 March. April 1450 in the Battle of Formigny. As a reward, he was awarded the dukedom of Touraine.

He eventually consented only after accepting that it was no longer compulsory to pass through Calais wool (the wool tax was the main income of the crown at the time).133 Tax revenues were reduced by 25% in 1369, due to the reminiscence of the Great Death in England. The English were unable to compete with taxes - up to 1,600,000 francs a year - which Charles V accepted in France to maintain permanent armies equipped for a siege war whose belligerents would not turn into Grandes Compagnies at the first truce. The English will be under constant pressure on all fronts for years134. The English tried to counter the reversal of the situation achieved by Charles . Much of the territories they believed to control had rebelled and they had lost the tax revenues that their Guyenne possessions could have provided them.

This English power-base in Brittany was resented by the Breton aristocrats and the French monarchy, as was John's use of English advisers. However, John IV declared himself a vassal to king Charles V of France, not to Edward III of England. Nevertheless, this gesture did not placate his critics, who saw the presence of rogue English troops and lords as destabilizing. Faced with the defiance of the Breton nobility, John IV was unable to muster military support against King Charles V, who took the opportunity to exert pressure over Brittany.

Olivier's mother, Jeanne de Clisson née de Belleville, swore Olivier and his brother Guillaume to avenge their father. She raised funds for an army to attack troops loyal to France, stationed in Brittany. Eventually she armed ships and started a piratical war against French ships. These ships were eventually lost and Jeanne with her two sons set adrift for five days.Guillaume died of thirst, cold and exhaustion. Olivier and his mother were finally rescued and taken to Morlaix by Montfort supporters.It was after these events that Olivier was taken by his mother to England in his youth. Hereafter, he was raised in the court of King Edward III alongside Jean IV de Montfort, a future claimant of the Ducal throne of Brittany.\nIn 1365 Jean IV besieged the city of Auray. The two opposing Breton armies clashed under the walls of the city on 29 September. Monfortistes were entrenched there and Jean IV attempted to overcome the numerical inferiority of his army by attacking the Breton-French camp by surprise. The Breton-English commander, however, adopted a proposal from Olivier and waited for the Breton-French army to climb a slope leading to Auray. They managed to divide the troops of Charles de Blois and were fought separately. Isolated from the bulk of his army, Charles de Blois was surrounded and killed in the melee, while Bertrand du Guesclin, the French Commander, was captured but released later with a ransom in 1365. The Breton War of Succession ended with this battle and Olivier had played an important role. Olivier was however injured and lost the use of one eye, earning him the nickname "the one-eyed man of Auray". \nThe widow of Charles de Blois, Joan, Duchess of Brittany, acceded to these events, and peace talks between the houses of Blois and Montfort started. Jean IV was nicknamed the Conqueror and was recognized as the only Duke of Brittany. Olivier, while nursing his injury learnt that Jean IV had given the English commander, John Chandos, the Gâvre castle and forest, a reward Olivier coveted for his loyal service. Olivier expressed his displeasure at the new Duke, but this did not change the matter. Olivier evidently raged "I would rather give myself to the devil than have an English neighbor" A fortnight later, the Gâvre castle was surprisingly burnt down. In response to this, Duke Jean IV confiscated the lordship of Châteauceaux from Olivier. "

He was the king's lieutenant in Ireland. De Windsor spent long periods of time away from England, thus making it less probable that the king would discover the marriage. The couple remained together until the death of the husband on 15 September 1384, but had no children."

 flavor_hyw.601.d:1 "While the early years of Edward's reign had been energetic and successful, his final years in power were marked by apathy, military failures and political unrest. The daily affairs of state had interested Edward less than his military campaigns. Thus, during the 1360s, Edward relied increasingly on the help of his subordinates, particularly William Wykeham . Wykeham, an upstart, was made Lord Privy Seal in 1363 and Lord Chancellor in 1367, although Parliament forced him to relinquish the chancellorship in 1371 because of political difficulties linked.\nIncreasingly, Edward began to rely on his sons for the leadership of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 John II died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by the vigorous Charles V, who enlisted the help of the capable Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne.\nMilitary failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent in England. Finance was a particular grievance; although it was rarely raised as an issue before 1371, after that time complaints about the royal household's expenditure were frequent. The problems came to a head in the Parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The Parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the King's closest advisors. Lord Chamberlain William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and Steward of the Household John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, were dismissed from their positions."

In 1355 the Hundred Years' War reignited, and John the Good had to convene the States-General, to finance his army of 30,000 men necessary to defend France. They were extremely suspicious of the question of public finances (angered by the devaluations brought about by repeated monetary changes), and would only accept a rise in the salt tax (the gabelle) if the States-General were able to control the application and the usage of the funds raised by it. The officers who would raise the tax had to be designated by the States-General, and ten representatives had to be on the king's counsel of the king in order to check the finances. This ordinance was ratified on 28 December 1355. \nThe Battle of Poitiers occurred on the 19 September 1356. In a new disaster for France, John II came close to victory but he and one of his young sons, Philip the Bold, were captured.\nThe beginnings of the Dauphin Charles's regency were fraught with difficulty, only 18, with little experience or personal prestige (unlike his father and brother he had quit the field of battle at Poitiers), and carrying the shame of the Valois dynasty on his shoulders.

The deputies of the Third Estate numbered 400. The Dauphin faced a strong opposition - Étienne Marcel headed the Bourgeoisie and the friends of Charles of Navarre regrouped around Robert le Coq, Bishop of Laon. Within the States-General, a committee of 80 members, formed on its own initiative to facilitate discussions, supported their claims. The States-General declared the Dauphin the king's lieutenant and defender of the kingdom in his father's absence and assigned him a counsel of twenty men (twelve nobles, twelve bourgeois and four clerks) as foreseen by the order of 1355. \nÉtienne Marcel sought to reform the government and the administration of the kingdom. In return for allowing the king to raise new taxes, he demanded the discharge of the seven most compromised counselors and the freeing of the King of Navarre. On these conditions, the states were disposed to vote for the period of one year the Dauphin an aid of a décime and a half on all the three orders' revenues. Not powerful enough to refuse these suggestions straight away, the Dauphin postponed his response (on the pretext of waiting for messengers from his father)), dissolved the States-General and left Paris for Metz to render homage to his maternal uncle emperor Charles IV. But, lacking money, he soon found himself at the mercy of Marcel, who had seized upon the indignation provoked by a new ordinance to change the currency (published on 10 December 1356) and caused all the guilds to take up arms; the Dauphin had to accept the dismissal of his counsellors, cancel the currency change and recall the States-General, to meet at the start of February 1357. On 3 March, after stormy debates, the Dauphin accepted the promulgation of the major "grande ordonnance" that had been voted for on 28 December during the States-General of 1355 and that his father had ratified just before departing to fight the English in summer 1356. Nine of the Dauphin's advisors were dismissed. Six representatives of the states entered the King's Council, which became a Guardianship Council.

His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the southeast of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local prisons. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to serfdom, and the removal of King Richard II's senior officials and law courts."

The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the community were killed.Isolated inside the Tower, the royal government was in a state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him.The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers.\nIt is uncertain who spoke for the rebels at Mile End, and Wat Tyler may not have been present on this occasion, but they appear to have put forward their various demands to the King, including the surrender of the hated officials on their lists for execution; the abolition of serfdom and unfree tenure; "that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester", and a general amnesty for the rebels. It is unclear precisely what was meant by the law of Winchester, but it probably referred to the rebel ideal of self-regulating village communities.\nWhile Richard was at Mile End, the Tower was taken by the rebels. Once inside, the rebels began to hunt down their key targets, and found Archbishop Sudbury and Robert Hales in the chapel of the White Tower. Along with William Appleton, John of Gaunt's physician, and John Legge, a royal sergeant, they were taken out to Tower Hill and beheaded. The rebels found John of Gaunt's son, the future Henry IV, and were about to execute him as well, when John Ferrour, one of the royal guards, successfully interceded on his behalf.

Richard queried why Tyler and the rebels had not yet left London following the signing of the charters the previous day, but this brought an angry rebuke from Tyler, who requested that a further charter be drawn up. The rebel leader rudely demanded refreshment and, once this had been provided, attempted to leave.\nAn argument then broke out between Tyler and some of the royal servants. The Lord Mayor of London, William Walworth, stepped forward to intervene, Tyler made some motion towards the King, and the royal soldiers leapt in. Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler.

The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace.znDespite the violence of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts.\nThere were no further attempts by Parliament to impose a poll tax or to reform England's fiscal system. The Commons instead concluded at the end of 1381 that the military effort on the Continent should be "carefully but substantially reduced". Unable to raise fresh taxes, the government had to curtail its foreign policy and military expeditions and began to examine the options for peace."

Louis, Duke of Anjou was the senior regent, but the three disagreed on policies for France.

English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. \nAlthough the official pretext was the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty, the legality of those continental possessions of English was the root cause as French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.\nIn 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle was established by Charles' predecessor Philip V and himself, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward.\nSo the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois becoming Philip VI of France. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.\nNow that France had came up with an interesting idea to solve the complex legality of the duchy, a Prince of Blood shall rule it instead of our king and become a permenant subject of French monarchy thus completely removing the sore point between the two nations."
