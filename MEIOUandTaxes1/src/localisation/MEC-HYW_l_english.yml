 desc_Italian_bank_loans_Default:1 "Edward III’s excuse for his attack on France in 1337 was that Philip VI had appropriated the English king’s duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu and was now threatening further attacks from across the channel. The French maintained their “auld alliance” with the Scots, who despite an agreement between his father and Robert the Bruce after the battle of Bannockburn. were still not helping matters by continuing to raid England across the borderlands and create mayhem in protest against any notion of deference to any English King.\nTo finance this endeavour Edward III chose to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and to borrow money from the famous Banking families of Florence. In particular the Ricciardi of Lucca (1272-1294), the Frescobaldi of Florence (c.1294-1312) the Bardi family and above all in relation to this story, the Peruzzi family who were, until 1345, the rich patrons of Giotto di Bondone.  The Peruzzi and the Bardi families were the two that were most impacted by the English loan.\nThe Peruzzi family family lent Edward III 600,000 gold florins, whilst the Bardi family gambled even more bravely and lent him 900,000 florins.Failing in his quest to become hailed as the King of France Edward reneged on these payments and this led to the declaration of Bancarotta and the collapse of both Bardi & Peruzzi families’ banks in 1345 – with the consequence of a lot of negative vibes between the Florentines and future English requests for loans!"

Pedro's lawful wife is the daughter of Duke of Bourbon had been humiliated and locked away due to delays in the payment of the dowry while he refuses Pope and Clergy's demand to ambandon his lover Maria. In the beginning, it was isolated acts of rebellion that were successfully suppressed by Pedro. Because of the failure of the rebellions, Enrique Trastámara finally fled to France and Aragon and found refuge there.

The Black prince received a hundred thousand francs from his father out of the ransom of John II, the late king of France, and broke up his plate to help to pay the soldiers he was taking into his pay. However, Pedro neither has the means nor the willingness to pay the debt.

Edward III sent him a hundred and thirty thousand pounds tournaments116. But the parliament is reluctant to pay for the Guyenne, which seems to cost more than it earns. He eventually consented only after accepting that it was no longer compulsory to pass through Calais wool (the wool tax was the main income of the crown at the time).133 Tax revenues were reduced by 25% in 1369, due to the reminiscence of the Great Death in England. The English were unable to compete with taxes - up to 1,600,000 francs a year - which Charles V accepted in France to maintain permanent armies equipped for a siege war whose belligerents would not turn into Grandes Compagnies at the first truce. The English will be under constant pressure on all fronts for years134. The English tried to counter the reversal of the situation achieved by Charles . Much of the territories they believed to control had rebelled and they had lost the tax revenues that their Guyenne possessions could have provided them. They plead before their Parliament to obtain the resources to counter-attack, but they cannot obtain the funding of garrisons for all the cities of Aquitaine, which they are no longer sure to hold. All in all, the King of England is far from having the financial means of Charles the parliament gives him only the means of a war self-financed by looting, especially since the ride of the Duke of Lancastre to Harfleur in 1369 is a relative success, and knowing that in the first phase of the war they have brought great victories over the long French ost crushed by the long-term victory in the French vigour."

Constantius was the eldest daughter of Pedro, killed in 1369 by the pretender to the throne Enrique of Trastamare, who had usurped the throne under the name of Enrique II. The coming to power in Castile of a pro-French king threatened English interests in Guyenne. The Black Prince and Lancaster had defended Pedro in 1367, defeating the Army of the Trastamare at the Battle of Nujera. On 29 January 1372, Lancaster officially claimed the crown of Castile and inscribes the coat of arms of Castile in its own coat of arms. It brings together a small Castilian court comprising the faithful of Pedro of Castile.\nLancaster wished to invade Castile to be crowned king, but his departure was delayed several times due to a lack of funding, as the war in France had ruined the crates of England. It was only after the accession of King John I erof Portugal in 1385, very Anglophile, that Lancaster decided to land in the Iberian Peninsula, assured of having an ally. The Anglo-Portuguese alliance was reinforced by the marriage of the King of Portugal with the eldest daughter of Ghent, Philippa of Lancaster."

This English power-base in Brittany was resented by the Breton aristocrats and the French monarchy, as was John's use of English advisers. However, John IV declared himself a vassal to king Charles V of France, not to Edward III of England. Nevertheless, this gesture did not placate his critics, who saw the presence of rogue English troops and lords as destabilizing. Faced with the defiance of the Breton nobility, John IV was unable to muster military support against King Charles V, who took the opportunity to exert pressure over Brittany. Without local support, in 1373, he was once more forced into exile to England."

He landed in Dinard and took control of the duchy once more with the support of local barons. An English army under Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, landed at Calais and marched towards Nantes to take control of the city. However, John IV subsequently reconciled with the new French king, Charles VI of France, and paid off the English troops to avoid a confrontation. He ruled his duchy thereafter in peace with the French and English crowns for over a decade, maintaining contact with both, but minimizing open links to England."

His father had been put to death by the French in 1343 on the suspicion of having willingly given up the city of Vannes to the English. Olivier's mother, Jeanne de Clisson née de Belleville, swore Olivier and his brother Guillaume to avenge their father. She raised funds for an army to attack troops loyal to France, stationed in Brittany. Eventually she armed ships and started a piratical war against French ships. These ships were eventually lost and Jeanne with her two sons set adrift for five days.Guillaume died of thirst, cold and exhaustion. Olivier and his mother were finally rescued and taken to Morlaix by Montfort supporters.It was after these events that Olivier was taken by his mother to England in his youth. Hereafter, he was raised in the court of King Edward III alongside Jean IV de Montfort, a future claimant of the Ducal throne of Brittany.\n In 1365 Jean IV besieged the city of Auray. The two opposing Breton armies clashed under the walls of the city on 29 September. Monfortistes were entrenched there and Jean IV attempted to overcome the numerical inferiority of his army by attacking the Breton-French camp by surprise. The Breton-English commander, however, adopted a proposal from Olivier and waited for the Breton-French army to climb a slope leading to Auray. They managed to divide the troops of Charles de Blois and were fought separately. Isolated from the bulk of his army, Charles de Blois was surrounded and killed in the melee, while Bertrand du Guesclin, the French Commander, was captured but released later with a ransom in 1365. The Breton War of Succession ended with this battle and Olivier had played an important role. Olivier was however injured and lost the use of one eye, earning him the nickname "the one-eyed man of Auray". \n The widow of Charles de Blois, Joan, Duchess of Brittany, acceded to these events, and peace talks between the houses of Blois and Montfort started. Jean IV was nicknamed the Conqueror and was recognized as the only Duke of Brittany. Olivier, while nursing his injury learnt that Jean IV had given the English commander, John Chandos, the Gâvre castle and forest, a reward Olivier coveted for his loyal service. Olivier expressed his displeasure at the new Duke, but this did not change the matter. Olivier evidently raged "I would rather give myself to the devil than have an English neighbor" A fortnight later, the Gâvre castle was surprisingly burnt down. In response to this, Duke Jean IV confiscated the lordship of Châteauceaux from Olivier. "

Louis was alongside du Guesclin and Olivier V de Clisson in the reconquest of Guienna. He served great services to King Charles V who appointed him marshal of France on 20 June 1368 to protect Paris threatened by Gascon and English companies; soon after he put him at the head of the Guienna army. It has since become known as maréchal de Sancerre. He was created instatable of France on July 26, 1397, upon the death of the Count of Eu, and was sworn in to the king on 22 July; during the summer he drove the Great Companies out of Languedoc"

She became the mistress of the king, Edward III around 1366, when she was around 18 years old and the king 55. The king showered Perrers with gifts, quickly making her an extremely wealthy woman. She amassed a fortune of more than £20,000. She was paraded around London in golden garments as the "Lady of the Sun" at the king's command, causing a wave of public criticism. Perrer's power further grew between 1370 and 1376. She reportedly provoked fear, and no one dared to sue her. She was seen as an ambitious, calculating, cold-hearted opportunist who manipulated the elderly king. Towards the end of Edward III's life, Perrers was even accused of making his life miserable. \nAs the king's health was ailing, Perrers contracted a secret marriage in November 1375, at the age of 27, with 53-year-old Sir William de Windsor, Baron Windsor to ensure her safety and livelihood after Edward's death. He was the king's lieutenant in Ireland. De Windsor spent long periods of time away from England, thus making it less probable that the king would discover the marriage. The couple remained together until the death of the husband on 15 September 1384, but had no children."

 flavor_hyw.601.d:1 "While the early years of Edward's reign had been energetic and successful, his final years in power were marked by apathy, military failures and political unrest. The daily affairs of state had interested Edward less than his military campaigns. Thus, during the 1360s, Edward relied increasingly on the help of his subordinates, particularly William Wykeham . Wykeham, an upstart, was made Lord Privy Seal in 1363 and Lord Chancellor in 1367, although Parliament forced him to relinquish the chancellorship in 1371 because of political difficulties linked.\nIncreasingly, Edward began to rely on his sons for the leadership of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 John II died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by the vigorous Charles V, who enlisted the help of the capable Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne.\nMilitary failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent in England. Finance was a particular grievance; although it was rarely raised as an issue before 1371, after that time complaints about the royal household's expenditure were frequent. The problems came to a head in the Parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The Parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the King's closest advisors. Lord Chamberlain William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and Steward of the Household John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, were dismissed from their positions."
