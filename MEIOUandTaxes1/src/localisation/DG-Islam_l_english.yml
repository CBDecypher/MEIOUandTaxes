 DG_Islam.001.title: "Sunni Schools of Thought"
 DG_Islam.001.desc: "Islamic schools (madhhab) have different understandings of Islam. There are many different sects or denominations, schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), and schools of Islamic theology, or ʿaqidah (creed).\n\n* The Hanafi school is the oldest of the four major Sunni Islamic schools of jurisprudence. It was established by the 8th century Kufan scholar Abu Hanifa. It is considered one of the most widely accepted legal school of thought (maddhab) amongst Sunni Muslim community and is called the Madhhab of Jurists. It encompasses not only the rulings and sayings of Abu Hanifa, but also the rulings and sayings of the judicial council he established.[citation needed] Abu Hanifa was the first to formally solve cases and organize them into chapters.\n\n* The Maliki school is teh second of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. It was founded by Malik ibn Anas in the 8th century. The Maliki school of jurisprudence relies on the Quran and hadiths as primary sources. Unlike other Islamic fiqhs, Maliki fiqh also considers the consensus of the people of Medina to be a valid source of Islamic law.\n\n* The Shafi'i school is the thrid of the four major traditional schools of religious law in the Sunni branch of Islam. It was founded by Muslim theologian Muḥammad ibn Idris al-Shafiʿi, the father of Muslim jurisprudence, in the early 9th century. The Shafi'i school affirms the authority of both divine law-giving (the Qurʾan and the Sunnah) and human speculation regarding the Law. Where passages of Qurʾan and/or the Ḥadiths are ambiguous, the school seeks guidance of Qiyas (analogical reasoning).\n\n* The Hanbali school is fourth and last of the four major traditional Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence. It is named after the Arab scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (died 855), and was institutionalized by his students. The Hanbali school derives sharia primarily from the Qur'an, the Hadiths (sayings and customs of Muhammad), and the views of Sahabah (Muhammad's companions). In cases where there is no clear answer in sacred texts of Islam, the Hanbali school does not accept istihsan (jurist discretion) or 'urf (customs of a community) as a sound basis to derive Islamic law.\n\n* The Zahiri school is a minor Sunni school of Islamic jurisprudence founded in the 9th century by Dawūd al-zahiri, a Muslim scholar, jurist, and theologian of the Islamic Golden Age. It is characterized by strict adherence to literalism and reliance on the outward (zahir) meaning of expressions in the Quran and ḥadith literature; the consensus (ijmaʿ) of the first generation of Muhammad's closest companions (sahaba), for sources of Islamic law (shariʿa); and rejection of analogical deduction (qiyas) and societal custom or knowledge (urf), used by other schools of Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nWhich madhhab do you want to follow?"

 DG_Islam.002.desc: "Islamic have different understandings of Islam. There are many different sects or denominations, schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and schools of Islamic theology, or ʿaqidah (creed).\n\n* The Jaʿfari school is the school of jurisprudence in Shia Islam, named after the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq. It differs from the predominant madhhabs of Sunni jurisprudence in its reliance on ijtihad, as well as on matters of inheritance, religious taxes, commerce, personal status, and the allowing of temporary marriage or mutʿa.\n\n* Isma'ilism is the second main branch of Shia Islam. The Isma'ili get their name from their acceptance of Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar as the appointed spiritual successor (imam) to Ja'far al-Sadiq. They focus on the metaphorical  nature of God, representing the manifestation of esoteric truth and intelligible divine reality, with the more literalistic Usuli and Akhbari groups focusing on divine law (sharia) and the deeds and sayings (sunnah) of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams who were guides and a light to God.\n\n* Zaydism is the third of the three main branches of Shia Islam that emerged in the eighth century following Zayd ibn Ali‘s unsuccessful rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate. Zaydism is typically considered to be a branch of Shia Islam that comes closest to the Sunni. The interpretation of Zaydi as Shia is often based on just their acceptance of Ali as a rightful successor to Muhammad. Zaydis regard the rationalism as more important than Quranic literalism.\n\n* The Alawites are a religious branch that splintered from the three main branches of Shi'ia Islam during the ninth century. The Quran is only one of their holy books and texts, and their interpretation thereof has very little in common with the Shia Muslim interpretation but is in accordance with the early Batiniyya and other ghulat sects. Alawite theology and rituals sharply differ from Shia Islam in several important ways. For instance, various rituals involve the drinking of wine and the sect does not prohibit the consumption of alcoholic drinks on its adherents. As a creed that teaches the symbolic/esoteric reading of Qur'anic verses, their theology is based on the belief in reincarnation and views Ali as a divine incarnation of God.\n\nWhich madhhab do you want to follow?"
