 salic_law.EVTNAME1: "Salic Law"
 salic_law.EVTDESC1: "For a remarkably long period, from the inception of the Capetian dynasty in 987 until the death of Louis X in 1316, the eldest living son of the King of France succeeded to the throne upon his demise. There was no prior occasion to demonstrate whether or not females were excluded from the succession to the crown. Louis X died without a son, but left his wife pregnant. The king's brother, Philip, Count of Poitiers, became regent. Philip prepared for the contingencies with Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy, maternal uncle of Louis X's daughter and prospective heiress, Joan. If the unborn child was male, he would succeed to the French throne as king; if female, Philip would maintain the regency until the daughters of Louis X reach their majority. There was opportunity for either daughter to succeed to the French throne. \n The unborn child proved to be male, John I, to the relief of the kingdom. But the infant lived for only a few days. Philip saw his chance and broke the agreement with the Duke of Burgundy by having himself anointed at Reims in January 1317 as Philip V of France. Agnes of France, daughter of Saint Louis, mother of the Duke of Burgundy, and maternal grandmother of the Princess Joan, considered it an usurpation and demanded an assembly of the peers, which Philip V accepted.\n An assembly of prelates, lords, the bourgeois of Paris and doctors of the University, known as the Estates-General of 1317, gathered in February. Philip V asked them to write an argument justifying his right to the throne of France. These "general statements" agreed in declaring that Women do not succeed in the kingdom of France, formalizing Philip's usurpation and the impossibility for a woman to ascend the throne of France, a principle in force until the end of the monarchy. The Salic law, at the time, was not yet invoked: the arguments put forward in favor of Philip V relied only on the degree of proximity of Philip V with St. Louis. Philip had the support of the nobility and had the resources for his ambitions. Philip, too, died without a son, and his brother Charles succeeded him as Charles IV unopposed. Charles, too, died without a son, but also left his wife pregnant. It was another succession crisis, the same as that in 1316. At this point, it had been accepted that women could not claim the crown of France (without any written rule stipulating it yet)."

 flavor_fra.6000.t:1 "Silk Capital of Europe"
 flavor_fra.6000.d:1 "Starting in the late 15th century, Lyon once again became a major hub for trade in France. Much was traded in the city, including spices, knives, weapons, and most importantly silk. Silk played a large historical and monetary role in the development of Lyon's economy. Introduced to Lyon in 1466, when Louis XI of France set up the first silk manufacture, the large demand for luxury silk goods by the french aristocracy led Lyon to become one of the worlds major producers of silk. in 1540, King Francois I granted Lyon the monopoly of silk manufacturing, ensuring that all silk goods produced in Italy or Asia traveling the Silk Roads would pass through Lyon's warehouses. In the 17th century, it was estimated that the city contained more than 10,000 silk looms, cementing Lyon as the global centre for silk weaving. In 1667 Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the superintended of finance to Louis XIV regulated the quality implications of silk production, and tariffs to be paid to workers. Thanks to these regulations, the social advancements and mastery of silk production helped Lyon become the worldwide capital of Silk in the late 17th century. In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a mechanical loom that rapidly industrialized the process of producing silk."
